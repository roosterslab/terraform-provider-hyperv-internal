# Windows OS Demo Full - Configuration Example
# Copy this file to terraform.tfvars and customize

# API endpoint
endpoint = "http://localhost:5000"

# VM name
vm_name = "win-demo-full"

# Path to parent Windows VHDX template (must exist and have Windows installed)
parent_vhdx_path = "C:/HyperV/VHDX/Users/Templates/windows-base.vhdx"

# VM resources
cpu_count = 4
memory_mb = 8192

# Network
switch_name = "Default Switch"

# Notes:
# - Parent template must be a Windows installation (sysprepped for cloning)
# - Parent must be in policy-allowed path
# - VM disks will be created in C:/HyperV/VHDX/Users/Demo/
# - OS disk will be differencing (references parent)
# - Data disk will be 100GB dynamic

# Examples for different scenarios:

# Development workstation
# cpu_count = 8
# memory_mb = 16384

# Test environment
# cpu_count = 2
# memory_mb = 4096

# Production VDI
# cpu_count = 4
# memory_mb = 8192
